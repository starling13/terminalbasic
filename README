ucBASIC is a lightweight BASIC-like language interpreter for
microcontroller-based systems.  It was inspired by the TinyBASIC port
for popular 8-bit AVR uc boards.

Arduino mega 2560-like boards are primary target for this project.
However the source code is not an arduino-ide sketch, but the set
of Netbeans C/C++ IDE projects. Moreover projects depend on the
arduino-ide and uses its toolchain.

The language, which ucBASIC will support one day is:

Lexems:
 * COM_DUMP = "DUMP"
 * COM_LIST = "LIST"
 * COM_NEW = "NEW"
 * COM_RUN = "RUN"
 * 
 * KW_END = "END"
 * KW_FOR = "FOR"
 * KW_GOSUB = "GOSUB"
 * KW_GOTO = "GOTO"
 * KW_IF = "IF"
 * KW_LET = "LET"
 * KW_NEXT = "NEXT"
 * KW_PRINT = "PRINT"
 * KW_RETURN = "RETURN"
 * 
 * KW_THEN = "THEN"
 * KW_TO = "TO"
 * KW_STEP = "STEP"
 * 
 * OP_AND = "AND"
 * OP_OR = "OR"
 * OP_NOT = "NOT"
 * 
 * COLON = ':'
 * SEMI = ';'
 * LT = '<'
 * LTE = "<="
 * GT = '>'
 * GTE = ">="
 * EQUALS = '='
 * NE = "<>"
 * NEA = "><"
 * MINUS = '-'
 * PLUS = '+'
 * STAR = '*'
 * SLASH = '/'
 * POW = '^'
 * IDENT = [A-Z][A-Z0-9]*
 * C_INTEGER = [0-9]+
 * C_REAL = [0-9]+[.][0-9]*
 
Grammar:
 * TEXT = OPERATORS | C_INTEGER OPERATORS
 * OPERATORS = OPERATOR | OPERATOR COLON OPERATORS
 * OPERATOR =
 *	COMMAND |
 *	KW_END |
 *	KW_RETURN |
 *	KW_PRINT PRINT_LIST |
 *	KW_IF EXPRESSION IF_STATEMENT |
 *	KW_FOR IMPLICIT_ASSIGNMENT KW_TO FOR_CONDS |
 *	KW_NEXT IDENT |
 *	ASSIGNMENT |TURN |
 *	GOTO_STATEMENT |
 *	KW_GOSUB INTEGER
 * COMMAND = COM_DUMP | COM_LIST | COM_NEW | COM_RUN
 * ASSIGNMENT = KW_LET IMPLICIT_ASSIGNMENT | IMPLICIT_ASSIGNMENT
 * IMPLICIT_ASSIGNMENT = IDENTIFIER EQUALS EXPRESSION
 * EXPRESSION = SIMPLE_EXPRESSION | SIMPLE_EXPRESSION REL SIMPLE_EXPRESSION
 * REL = LT | LTE | EQUALS | GT | GTE | NE | NEA
 * SIMPLE_EXPRESSION = TERM | TERM ADD TERM
 * ADD = PLUS MINUS KW_OR
 * TERM = FACTOR | FACTOR MUL FACTOR
 * MUL = STAR | SLASH | DIV | MOD | KW_AND
 * FACTOR = FINAL | FINAL POW FINAL
 * FINAL = IDENT | INTEGER | REAL | LPAREN EXPRESSION RPAREN | MINUS FINAL
 * PRINT_LIST = EXPRESSION | EXPRESSION COMMA PRINT_LIST
 * IF_STATEMENT = GOTO_STATEMEMNT | KW_THEN OPERATORS
 * GOTO_STATEMENT = KW_GOTO C_INTEGER
 * FOR_CONDS = EXPRESSION | EXPRESSION KW_STEP EXPRESSION
